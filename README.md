### **Create, manage, and build in protected plots. Keep your builds safe from griefers!**

#### Please note that the [API3 Branch](https://github.com/jasonwynn10/MyPlot/tree/API3) is actively under development for the new changes in PocketMine 3.0.0 and may not work all the time. The [master branch](https://github.com/jasonwynn10/MyPlot/tree/master) is for compatability with 0.16 clients.
#### Official MyPlot precompiled builds can be found on [Poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/jasonwynn10/MyPlot/MyPlot) at https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/jasonwynn10/MyPlot/MyPlot

Have you ever seen those Java servers with the PlotMe plugin and thought "Hey, why can't I have plots on my Minecraft server?" Well, now you can with **MyPlot** for PocketMine-MP!

A list of commands and permissions can be found in the [MyPlot Wiki](http://jasonwynn10.github.io/MyPlot/cmdsandperms) along with a helpful config guide [here](http://jasonwynn10.github.io/MyPlot/configurations).

Want to help create language packs? If you know a language that is not created yet, you can create a new language pack by opening a pull request! If the language you know is already created, you can help improve it by editing it. Many of the current resource packs are outdated anyway :P

###### *NOTE:* MyPlot is designed to only support pmmp's version of the PocketMine-MP server software and will not work with third party builds.
